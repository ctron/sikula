## Rationale

_Another query language, are you serious?_

Actually it isn't that new. But naming it "Query language similar to GitHub's search syntax" (QLSTGHSS)
wasn't a real option.

Think of it more as an implementation of a familiar syntax.

_What's the difference then?_

They are subtle. But I don't want to spoil the surprise. Or maybe I am just too lazy documenting it. ü§∑

## Example

Assuming you have an enum defined for searching e-mails:

```rust
use sikula::prelude::*;

#[derive(Search)]
pub enum MyResource<'a> {
     #[search(scope, default)]
     Subject(Primary<'a>),
     #[search(scope)]
     Body(Primary<'a>),

     Sender(&'a str),

     #[search(sort)]
     Sent(Ordered<time::OffsetDateTime>),
     #[search(sort)]
     Size(Ordered<usize>),

     #[search(sort)]
     Header(Qualified<'a, &'a str>),

     Read,
     Important,
 }
```

The `Query` derive provides the trait implementation. The `#[query(scope)]` attribute flags the variant `Subject`
as `Body` scopes for the primary search terms, marking `Subject` as the default if none was selected.

In general, there are three types of terms: Primary, Qualifiers, Predicates. Predicates are simple "is this condition
true" style of filters. If an enum variant doesn't have any value, it is a predicate.

Qualifiers are additional matching criteria, which depend on the type of the value.

With the `#[query(sort)]` flag, a field can be used for sorting the result. 

Now, you can do the following queries:

| Query                                             | Retrieves all entries‚Ä¶                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foo`                                             | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in the "subject"                                                               |
| `foo in:subject in:body`                          | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in either "subject" or "body"                                                  |
| `foo in:subject in:body is:read`                  | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in either "subject" or "body" being "read"                                     |

| `foo sort:sent`                                   | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in the subject, sorted by "sent" ascending                                     |
