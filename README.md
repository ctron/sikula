## Rationale

_Another query language, are you serious?_

Actually it isn't that new. But naming it "Query language similar to GitHub's search syntax" (QLSTGHSS)
wasn't a real option.

Think of it more as an implementation of a familiar syntax.

_What's the difference then?_

They are subtle. But I don't want to spoil the surprise. Or maybe I am just too lazy documenting it. ü§∑

## Example

Assuming you have an enum defined for searching e-mails:

```rust
#[derive(Query)]
pub enum MyResource<'a> {
    #[query(scope, default)]
    Subject(Primary<'a>),
    #[query(scope)]
    Body(Primary<'a>),

    Sender(&'a str),
    
    #[query(sort)]
    Sent(Ordered<time::OffsetDateTime>),
    #[query(sort)]
    Size(Ordered<sized>),

    #[query(sort)]
    Header(Qualified<'a, &'a str>),
    
    Read,
    Important,
}
```

The `Query` derive provides the trait implementation. The `#[query(scope)]` attribute flags the variant `Subject`
as `Body` scopes for the primary search terms, marking `Subject` as the default if none was selected.

In general, there are three types of terms: Primary, Qualifiers, Predicates. Predicates are simple "is this condition
true" style of filters. If an enum variant doesn't have any value, it is a predicate.

Qualifiers are additional matching criteria, which depend on the type of the value.

With the `#[query(sort)]` flag, a field can be used for sorting the result. 

Now, you can do the following queries:

| Query                                             | Retrieves all entries‚Ä¶                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foo`                                             | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in the "subject"                                                               |
| `foo in:subject in:body`                          | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in either "subject" or "body"                                                  |
| `foo in:subject in:body is:read`                  | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in either "subject" or "body" being "read"                                     |
| `foo bar`                                         | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" and "bar" in the subject                                                       |
| `size:>10000`                                     | ‚Ä¶ having a size greater than 10000                                                                |
| `size:100..200`                                   | ‚Ä¶ having a size between 100 (inclusive) and 200 (exclusive)                                       |
| `-is:read`                                        | ‚Ä¶ being "not read"                                                                                |
| `foo sort:sent`                                   | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in the subject, sorted by "sent" ascending                                       | 
| `foo -sort:sent`                                  | ‚Ä¶ containing "foo" in the subject, sorted by "sent" descending                                      |
| `sender:"Max Mustermann"`                         | ‚Ä¶ having a sender of `Max Mustermann`                                                             |
| `sender:"Max Mustermann" sender:"Eva Mustermann"` | ‚Ä¶ having a sender of `Max Mustermann` and `Eva Mustermann` (most likely no results will be found) |

## ToDo

* [x] Implement the derive (waiting to stabilize the API)
* [ ] Re-consider `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and groups
* [ ] Re-export chumsky
